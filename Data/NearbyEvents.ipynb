With the help of ambitious emission-reduction targets, growing support from government and rapid industry and technological developments we're close to significant expansion.\\nThe Government's much-anticipated Climate Action Plan has recently been published, setting out a roadmap for how Ireland will meet its greenhouse gas targets. Much of the focus is on EVs, with the aim to have almost 1 million electric vehicles on our roads by 2030. The number of charge points will be increased in the coming years and fees for their use will be introduced. Local authorities will also be rolling out about 200 charge points nationwide.\\nThese are exciting and interesting times for the EV industry.
