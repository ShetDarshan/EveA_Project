      "In the Shadow of the Eighth is the story of Peter Boylan's life in medicine. Having realised as a young doctor that Irish women's reproductive lives were shaped by church and state, particularly by the Eighth Amendment, Boylan vowed to do what he could to change things. Throughout his forty year career, seven of these as Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Boylan has remained calm, measured and steadfast. As an obstetrician, he has attended the births of more than 6,000 babies and has seen women and families at their most vulnerable, their most joyous, and sometimes their most heart-broken. This memoir is at once a revealing behind-the-scenes insight into what it's like trying to make change happen and a fascinating, vital and encouraging portrait of a society in transition.\n",

Evidence supporting RMT in diverse patient populations will be discussed, including treatment protocols, with an emphasis on patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia. Devices used for RMT assessment and treatment are on-site for hands-on integration of techniques. Strategies and support for program development are provided.

      "In the Shadow of the Eighth is the story of Peter Boylan's life in medicine. Having realised as a young doctor that Irish women's reproductive lives were shaped by church and state, particularly by the Eighth Amendment, Boylan vowed to do what he could to change things. Throughout his forty year career, seven of these as Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Boylan has remained calm, measured and steadfast. As an obstetrician, he has attended the births of more than 6,000 babies and has seen women and families at their most vulnerable, their most joyous, and sometimes their most heart-broken. This memoir is at once a revealing behind-the-scenes insight into what it's like trying to make change happen and a fascinating, vital and encouraging portrait of a society in transition.\n",

Having realised as a young doctor that Irish women's reproductive lives were shaped by church and state, particularly by the Eighth Amendment, Boylan vowed to do what he could to change things. Throughout his forty year career, seven of these as Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Boylan has remained calm, measured and steadfast.

      "\"What you think, you become.\" - Buddha (In aid of Edel Kennedy - details at bottom of page)Based on the concepts and principles taken from  the MASTER System,  a universal concept with its roots in psychology, neuro- reprogramming, hypnosis, nlp, mindfulness, sport & business psychology and common practical sense.The basis is that whether we want to change ourselves or others, there is a common law outlining these steps. A law dictated by the rules of life and more importantly our minds and how it works. To make beneficial changes in our lives, both on a mental capacity and also a physical and practical level, we want to implement these steps in this way to reach that success.Whether you want to have more focus, clarity, peace of mind or happiness, there is a specific way and program to address this in the best way.There is also an easier way to create deeper and more authentic relationships in both business or your personal life, by communicating in the most effective way.And yes, there is a way to communicate with yourself more beneficially also. A way to still and quiet that unruly mind and turn it into a tool for your mastering more success, happiness and fulfilment.The acclaimed self development book, The BlackBelt MasterMind by Danielle Serpico, outlines these steps. After discovering and developing this M.A.S.T.E.R  process and helping herself fight back in life after major set back, she went on to share this message with others.* Danielle Serpico is your Host for The MASTER'ing your Mind Conference *As well as her background as a Martial artist, European Champion BlackBelt, Entrepreneur,  Business woman and Radio Broadcaster with her weekly Mental Health & Wellbeing Show on overcoming adversity - MindMatters on 103.2 Dublin City FM, she is also your Mind Coach, Neuro- Linguistic Practitioner, Master Practitioner and Trainer & Founder of The BBMM Academy.\n",

Why it's so 'bad' for us. Why we get stressed. And what the hell to do about itThis is a huge topic - with a lot of highly esteemed scientists and practitioners having various opinions and strategies.I've also decide to explore 'dealing' with stress in 3 broad ways. Dealing with the physiological response, dealing with our perceptions of stressful situations and practically dealing with stressors (problem solving).Please RSVP as I'll need to set the venue for appropriate numbersSee you on December 3rdJayson\n",

Helen currently works fully in private practice in Dublin and London and has been tutoring with the POGP since 2015.What you will learn from attending this course:- Why a standing or functional assessment of the female pelvic floor is beneficial and necessary addition to your toolkit- Functional assessment skills of the pelvic floor muscles that are transferable to females from ANY background - from nulliparous to multiparous, from the power lifter struggling to maintain continence at their maximum lift to the deconditioned female struggling with prolapse symptoms by the time it gets to midday.- The confidence to perform vaginal assessments in positions and movements other than crook lyingCourse schedule:9:45\tRegistration10:00  Welcome & Introduction10:15\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor (tutorial)11:45   Functional assessment of the female pelvic floor during standing (practical)13:30   Lunch14:00\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor during movement including sit to stand/squat and deadlift (practical)15:15   Refreshment break15:30   The pelvic floor during high impact & how to coach women back to this (tutorial)16:30\tCourse end In order to attend this course it is crucial that you are already trained in vaginal assessments and working within pelvic health. You do not, however, need to be versed in CrossFit, weight lifting or any other sport – the exercise element is just one arm of this course – the main focus is on function which is applicable to ALL patients.“As a keen exerciser, I need to know that my pelvic floor is functioning well in positions beyond just lying. That Helen could assess me in this way was a huge selling point for me.”\tTara, 37“As a novice power-lifter I had been having issues with leaking and deadlifts. I had been trying to figure it out myself by trying different bracing, belts and breathing techniques. Helen however was easily able to assess my pelvic floor during all different braces, breathing methods and during the deadlift! We quickly figured out the best strategy forward for me & this has been invaluable for my training.”\tJane, 50“I had noticed that my prolapse symptoms were only noticeable in standing or after a long walk. I hadn’t even heard of having a pelvic floor check in standing before but it added so much to my awareness of how to engage my muscles in this position. I am so much less aware now of my symptoms but more importantly, know exactly what to work on to improve them going forward”\tSarah, 39\n",

Join Dublin coaching team The Reluctant Gurus in this introductory workshop exploring the relationship between creativity and mindfulness - no previous experience required! Suitable for everyone from complete novices to professional artists, you will take part in a mix of fun and relaxing practical exercises designed to bring greater presence, fulfilment and creativity to your everyday life.Being creative is incredibly beneficial to your mental health. As children we are given the space to explore and create every day - and this is an integral part of how we make sense of the world and manage our emotions growing up. As adults, we often don’t prioritise time for this. In this fun and informative workshop, we will revisit how to bring this sense of creativity and imagination back into your day to day, with the aim of encouraging more present, mindful living.In this workshop, we will be specifically focusing on the following concepts:MindfulnessFinding your innate creativity  “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.” - Pablo PicassoCreative flowJoyful living ‘Always leave enough time in your life to do something that makes you happy, satisfied, even joyous. That has more of an effect on economic wellbeing than any single factor.’Some examples of what we’ll be doing on the day:* Automatic drawing and writing* Creative paper crafting * Symbols and mandalas* Japanese HaikusAnd much more!Buzz from previous workshops:‘This is really great workshop to become more creative human being it learns how to overcome your fears, because of that this is very therapeutic and bring more joy in your life. I'm truly recommend it for people who would like get on with their live in much happier fashion.’ - Roman‘Did the creative course with Anne Marie and Shannon yesterday and truly enjoyed it! They talked about how being creative can help your wellbeing, common beliefs that might hold us back from exploring our own creativity and how to overcome them. We did light and fun exercises like drawing, writing and accepting that not all cretive projects are going to be finished. I can truly recomend this workshop for everyone!’ - IsabelSpaces are very limited at only 20 places, so book now to avoid disappointment.

You know there are deeper levels of understanding, deeper benefits and you want to experience them.During this level two workshop, that is exactly what you will learn.Introducing advanced breathingThe breathing practise has profound effects on us. We’ll be exploring new ways to use the breathing to change how we feel and think, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stress.Deeper cold exposureWe know that gradual exposure to the cold has many benefits, including strengthening our immune system, balancing our hormone levels and elevating our mood.Advanced focusUnderpinning all of this more advanced work, is improved focus and determination. Each step of the way, you will be gaining further mastery of your body and mind.  Who can attend this advanced training?People who have attended my fundamentals workshopsPeople who have completed the 10-week or fundamentals online coursesIf you have been practising the method consistently over a long period of timeBenefits of advanced trainingImproved health and moodIncreased knowledge of the method and yourself Engrain the method more deeply into your everyday lifeIt will give you practical tools that you can use to stay healthy and heal yourselfOpportunity to discuss your experiences of the method and learn from othersMore benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityFrequently asked questions What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching. If you like, bring a light blanket as people sometimes get cold when then are lying down during the breathing.Do I need to prepare for the workshop?Continue to practise the Wim Hof Method regularly. When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. Also, it will include a health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out. If you have done a workshop, or class, with us before, we’ll have your forms on file.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\n",

      "\"What you think, you become.\" - Buddha (In aid of Edel Kennedy - details at bottom of page)Based on the concepts and principles taken from  the MASTER System,  a universal concept with its roots in psychology, neuro- reprogramming, hypnosis, nlp, mindfulness, sport & business psychology and common practical sense.The basis is that whether we want to change ourselves or others, there is a common law outlining these steps. A law dictated by the rules of life and more importantly our minds and how it works. To make beneficial changes in our lives, both on a mental capacity and also a physical and practical level, we want to implement these steps in this way to reach that success.Whether you want to have more focus, clarity, peace of mind or happiness, there is a specific way and program to address this in the best way.There is also an easier way to create deeper and more authentic relationships in both business or your personal life, by communicating in the most effective way.And yes, there is a way to communicate with yourself more beneficially also. A way to still and quiet that unruly mind and turn it into a tool for your mastering more success, happiness and fulfilment.The acclaimed self development book, The BlackBelt MasterMind by Danielle Serpico, outlines these steps. After discovering and developing this M.A.S.T.E.R  process and helping herself fight back in life after major set back, she went on to share this message with others.* Danielle Serpico is your Host for The MASTER'ing your Mind Conference *As well as her background as a Martial artist, European Champion BlackBelt, Entrepreneur,  Business woman and Radio Broadcaster with her weekly Mental Health & Wellbeing Show on overcoming adversity - MindMatters on 103.2 Dublin City FM, she is also your Mind Coach, Neuro- Linguistic Practitioner, Master Practitioner and Trainer & Founder of The BBMM Academy.\n",

Why it's so 'bad' for us. Why we get stressed. And what the hell to do about itThis is a huge topic - with a lot of highly esteemed scientists and practitioners having various opinions and strategies.I've also decide to explore 'dealing' with stress in 3 broad ways. Dealing with the physiological response, dealing with our perceptions of stressful situations and practically dealing with stressors (problem solving).Please RSVP as I'll need to set the venue for appropriate numbersSee you on December 3rdJayson\n",

      "Do any of your patients report leaking on sit to stand or with certain movements/exercise?Do any of your patients ever say that their prolapse symptoms are worse with standing, after walking or at the end of the day?Do you want to increase your confidence and skills to advance your internal assessments in positions and movements beyond just crook lying?Do you want to establish if what is found during vaginal examination in lying is really that different to what is found in standing or other functional movements?Do you want to set yourself apart as a physiotherapist who is truly empowering your clients to get to where they want to be?Then this is the course for you! Let’s face it, women do not spend their lives on their backs! This course will show you why we owe it to our female patients to be able to assess, and therefore treat, them in positions and movements that are applicable specifically to them. Adopting this approach sees greater patient compliance and more efficient treatment results.This unique functional pelvic floor assessment course is presented to you by Helen Keeble. Helen is an experienced and passionate pelvic health physiotherapist with a specialist interest in female sports. Helen has worked with many different types of female exercisers over the years, covering most disciplines. Helen spent 18 months of her career working inside a CrossFit gym assessing and treating female pelvic health complaints related to a huge variety of functional movements and positions (eg jumping, running, squatting and lifting) from all kinds of backgrounds; from the complete novice to the competing professional athlete. Helen currently works fully in private practice in Dublin and London and has been tutoring with the POGP since 2015.What you will learn from attending this course:- Why a standing or functional assessment of the female pelvic floor is beneficial and necessary addition to your toolkit- Functional assessment skills of the pelvic floor muscles that are transferable to females from ANY background - from nulliparous to multiparous, from the power lifter struggling to maintain continence at their maximum lift to the deconditioned female struggling with prolapse symptoms by the time it gets to midday.- The confidence to perform vaginal assessments in positions and movements other than crook lyingCourse schedule:9:45\tRegistration10:00  Welcome & Introduction10:15\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor (tutorial)11:45   Functional assessment of the female pelvic floor during standing (practical)13:30   Lunch14:00\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor during movement including sit to stand/squat and deadlift (practical)15:15   Refreshment break15:30   The pelvic floor during high impact & how to coach women back to this (tutorial)16:30\tCourse end In order to attend this course it is crucial that you are already trained in vaginal assessments and working within pelvic health. You do not, however, need to be versed in CrossFit, weight lifting or any other sport – the exercise element is just one arm of this course – the main focus is on function which is applicable to ALL patients.“As a keen exerciser, I need to know that my pelvic floor is functioning well in positions beyond just lying. That Helen could assess me in this way was a huge selling point for me.”\tTara, 37“As a novice power-lifter I had been having issues with leaking and deadlifts. I had been trying to figure it out myself by trying different bracing, belts and breathing techniques. Helen however was easily able to assess my pelvic floor during all different braces, breathing methods and during the deadlift! We quickly figured out the best strategy forward for me & this has been invaluable for my training.”\tJane, 50“I had noticed that my prolapse symptoms were only noticeable in standing or after a long walk. I hadn’t even heard of having a pelvic floor check in standing before but it added so much to my awareness of how to engage my muscles in this position. I am so much less aware now of my symptoms but more importantly, know exactly what to work on to improve them going forward”\tSarah, 39\n",

Suitable for everyone from complete novices to professional artists, you will take part in a mix of fun and relaxing practical exercises designed to bring greater presence, fulfilment and creativity to your everyday life.Being creative is incredibly beneficial to your mental health. As children we are given the space to explore and create every day - and this is an integral part of how we make sense of the world and manage our emotions growing up. As adults, we often don’t prioritise time for this. In this fun and informative workshop, we will revisit how to bring this sense of creativity and imagination back into your day to day, with the aim of encouraging more present, mindful living.In this workshop, we will be specifically focusing on the following concepts:MindfulnessFinding your innate creativity  “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.” - Pablo PicassoCreative flowJoyful living ‘Always leave enough time in your life to do something that makes you happy, satisfied, even joyous. That has more of an effect on economic wellbeing than any single factor.’Some examples of what we’ll be doing on the day:* Automatic drawing and writing* Creative paper crafting * Symbols and mandalas* Japanese HaikusAnd much more!Buzz from previous workshops:‘This is really great workshop to become more creative human being it learns how to overcome your fears, because of that this is very therapeutic and bring more joy in your life. I'm truly recommend it for people who would like get on with their live in much happier fashion.’ - Roman‘Did the creative course with Anne Marie and Shannon yesterday and truly enjoyed it! They talked about how being creative can help your wellbeing, common beliefs that might hold us back from exploring our own creativity and how to overcome them. We did light and fun exercises like drawing, writing and accepting that not all cretive projects are going to be finished.

We’ll be exploring new ways to use the breathing to change how we feel and think, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stress.Deeper cold exposureWe know that gradual exposure to the cold has many benefits, including strengthening our immune system, balancing our hormone levels and elevating our mood.Advanced focusUnderpinning all of this more advanced work, is improved focus and determination. Each step of the way, you will be gaining further mastery of your body and mind.  Who can attend this advanced training?People who have attended my fundamentals workshopsPeople who have completed the 10-week or fundamentals online coursesIf you have been practising the method consistently over a long period of timeBenefits of advanced trainingImproved health and moodIncreased knowledge of the method and yourself Engrain the method more deeply into your everyday lifeIt will give you practical tools that you can use to stay healthy and heal yourselfOpportunity to discuss your experiences of the method and learn from othersMore benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityFrequently asked questions What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching. If you like, bring a light blanket as people sometimes get cold when then are lying down during the breathing.Do I need to prepare for the workshop?Continue to practise the Wim Hof Method regularly. When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. Also, it will include a health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out. If you have done a workshop, or class, with us before, we’ll have your forms on file.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\n",

Helen currently works fully in private practice in Dublin and London and has been tutoring with the POGP since 2015.What you will learn from attending this course:- Why a standing or functional assessment of the female pelvic floor is beneficial and necessary addition to your toolkit- Functional assessment skills of the pelvic floor muscles that are transferable to females from ANY background - from nulliparous to multiparous, from the power lifter struggling to maintain continence at their maximum lift to the deconditioned female struggling with prolapse symptoms by the time it gets to midday.- The confidence to perform vaginal assessments in positions and movements other than crook lyingCourse schedule:9:45\\tRegistration10:00  Welcome & Introduction10:15\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor (tutorial)11:45   Functional assessment of the female pelvic floor during standing (practical)13:30   Lunch14:00\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor during movement including sit to stand/squat and deadlift (practical)15:15   Refreshment break15:30   The pelvic floor during high impact & how to coach women back to this (tutorial)16:30\\tCourse end In order to attend this course it is crucial that you are already trained in vaginal assessments and working within pelvic health. You do not, however, need to be versed in CrossFit, weight lifting or any other sport – the exercise element is just one arm of this course – the main focus is on function which is applicable to ALL patients.“As a keen exerciser, I need to know that my pelvic floor is functioning well in positions beyond just lying. That Helen could assess me in this way was a huge selling point for me.”\\tTara, 37“As a novice power-lifter I had been having issues with leaking and deadlifts. I had been trying to figure it out myself by trying different bracing, belts and breathing techniques. Helen however was easily able to assess my pelvic floor during all different braces, breathing methods and during the deadlift! We quickly figured out the best strategy forward for me & this has been invaluable for my training.”\\tJane, 50“I had noticed that my prolapse symptoms were only noticeable in standing or after a long walk. I hadn’t even heard of having a pelvic floor check in standing before but it added so much to my awareness of how to engage my muscles in this position. I am so much less aware now of my symptoms but more importantly, know exactly what to work on to improve them going forward”\\tSarah, 39'}, {'title': 'Founders Day 2019  - Exploring Anxiety and Mental Health', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/seating-assessment-solutions-level-2-tickets-74088182749?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €500.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F74260427%2F205475140691%2F1%2Foriginal.20190226-134553?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C17%2C1252%2C626&s=934d21c300fa0919fb6ca1138c2b35ed', 'date': '25 November 2019', 'time': '', 'location': 'Dublin Children Services Building, Enable Ireland • Sandymount', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': 'Level 2 training builds on the foundation training of SeatTech Seating and Solutions Level 1 which provides an overview of general solutions for the more common seating and mobility presentations.

Suitable for everyone from complete novices to professional artists, you will take part in a mix of fun and relaxing practical exercises designed to bring greater presence, fulfilment and creativity to your everyday life.Being creative is incredibly beneficial to your mental health. As children we are given the space to explore and create every day - and this is an integral part of how we make sense of the world and manage our emotions growing up. As adults, we often don’t prioritise time for this. In this fun and informative workshop, we will revisit how to bring this sense of creativity and imagination back into your day to day, with the aim of encouraging more present, mindful living.In this workshop, we will be specifically focusing on the following concepts:MindfulnessFinding your innate creativity  “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.” - Pablo PicassoCreative flowJoyful living ‘Always leave enough time in your life to do something that makes you happy, satisfied, even joyous. That has more of an effect on economic wellbeing than any single factor.’Some examples of what we’ll be doing on the day:* Automatic drawing and writing* Creative paper crafting * Symbols and mandalas* Japanese HaikusAnd much more!Buzz from previous workshops:‘This is really great workshop to become more creative human being it learns how to overcome your fears, because of that this is very therapeutic and bring more joy in your life. I'm truly recommend it for people who would like get on with their live in much happier fashion.’ - Roman‘Did the creative course with Anne Marie and Shannon yesterday and truly enjoyed it! They talked about how being creative can help your wellbeing, common beliefs that might hold us back from exploring our own creativity and how to overcome them. We did light and fun exercises like drawing, writing and accepting that not all cretive projects are going to be finished. I can truly recomend this workshop for everyone!’ - IsabelSpaces are very limited at only 20 places, so book now to avoid disappointment.

But, you know there is more. You know there are deeper levels of understanding, deeper benefits and you want to experience them.During this level two workshop, that is exactly what you will learn.Introducing advanced breathingThe breathing practise has profound effects on us. We’ll be exploring new ways to use the breathing to change how we feel and think, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stress.Deeper cold exposureWe know that gradual exposure to the cold has many benefits, including strengthening our immune system, balancing our hormone levels and elevating our mood.Advanced focusUnderpinning all of this more advanced work, is improved focus and determination. Each step of the way, you will be gaining further mastery of your body and mind.  Who can attend this advanced training?People who have attended my fundamentals workshopsPeople who have completed the 10-week or fundamentals online coursesIf you have been practising the method consistently over a long period of timeBenefits of advanced trainingImproved health and moodIncreased knowledge of the method and yourself Engrain the method more deeply into your everyday lifeIt will give you practical tools that you can use to stay healthy and heal yourselfOpportunity to discuss your experiences of the method and learn from othersMore benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityFrequently asked questions What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching. If you like, bring a light blanket as people sometimes get cold when then are lying down during the breathing.Do I need to prepare for the workshop?Continue to practise the Wim Hof Method regularly. When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. Also, it will include a health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out. If you have done a workshop, or class, with us before, we’ll have your forms on file.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\"}, {'title': 'Founders Day 2019  - Exploring Anxiety and Mental Health', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tackle-your-feelings-aib-workshop-tickets-81468306899?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Free', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F80564725%2F211724879756%2F1%2Foriginal.20191112-112656?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C24%2C796%2C398&s=9acc2de2509f3bd9c9bd354b2d79405a', 'date': '3 December 2019', 'time': '', 'location': 'Presentation Room • Dublin', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': \"Tackle Your Feelings is hitting the road!

To make beneficial changes in our lives, both on a mental capacity and also a physical and practical level, we want to implement these steps in this way to reach that success.Whether you want to have more focus, clarity, peace of mind or happiness, there is a specific way and program to address this in the best way.There is also an easier way to create deeper and more authentic relationships in both business or your personal life, by communicating in the most effective way.And yes, there is a way to communicate with yourself more beneficially also. A way to still and quiet that unruly mind and turn it into a tool for your mastering more success, happiness and fulfilment.The acclaimed self development book, The BlackBelt MasterMind by Danielle Serpico, outlines these steps.

Let’s face it, women do not spend their lives on their backs! This course will show you why we owe it to our female patients to be able to assess, and therefore treat, them in positions and movements that are applicable specifically to them. Adopting this approach sees greater patient compliance and more efficient treatment results.This unique functional pelvic floor assessment course is presented to you by Helen Keeble. Helen is an experienced and passionate pelvic health physiotherapist with a specialist interest in female sports. Helen has worked with many different types of female exercisers over the years, covering most disciplines. Helen spent 18 months of her career working inside a CrossFit gym assessing and treating female pelvic health complaints related to a huge variety of functional movements and positions (eg jumping, running, squatting and lifting) from all kinds of backgrounds; from the complete novice to the competing professional athlete. Helen currently works fully in private practice in Dublin and London and has been tutoring with the POGP since 2015.What you will learn from attending this course:- Why a standing or functional assessment of the female pelvic floor is beneficial and necessary addition to your toolkit- Functional assessment skills of the pelvic floor muscles that are transferable to females from ANY background - from nulliparous to multiparous, from the power lifter struggling to maintain continence at their maximum lift to the deconditioned female struggling with prolapse symptoms by the time it gets to midday.- The confidence to perform vaginal assessments in positions and movements other than crook lyingCourse schedule:9:45\\tRegistration10:00  Welcome & Introduction10:15\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor (tutorial)11:45   Functional assessment of the female pelvic floor during standing (practical)13:30   Lunch14:00\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor during movement including sit to stand/squat and deadlift (practical)15:15   Refreshment break15:30   The pelvic floor during high impact & how to coach women back to this (tutorial)16:30\\tCourse end In order to attend this course it is crucial that you are already trained in vaginal assessments and working within pelvic health. You do not, however, need to be versed in CrossFit, weight lifting or any other sport – the exercise element is just one arm of this course – the main focus is on function which is applicable to ALL patients.“As a keen exerciser, I need to know that my pelvic floor is functioning well in positions beyond just lying. That Helen could assess me in this way was a huge selling point for me.”\\tTara, 37“As a novice power-lifter I had been having issues with leaking and deadlifts. I had been trying to figure it out myself by trying different bracing, belts and breathing techniques. Helen however was easily able to assess my pelvic floor during all different braces, breathing methods and during the deadlift! We quickly figured out the best strategy forward for me & this has been invaluable for my training.”\\tJane, 50“I had noticed that my prolapse symptoms were only noticeable in standing or after a long walk. I hadn’t even heard of having a pelvic floor check in standing before but it added so much to my awareness of how to engage my muscles in this position. I am so much less aware now of my symptoms but more importantly, know exactly what to work on to improve them going forward”\\tSarah, 39'}, {'title': 'Founders Day 2019  - Exploring Anxiety and Mental Health', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/seating-assessment-solutions-level-2-tickets-74088182749?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €500.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F74260427%2F205475140691%2F1%2Foriginal.20190226-134553?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C17%2C1252%2C626&s=934d21c300fa0919fb6ca1138c2b35ed', 'date': '25 November 2019', 'time': '', 'location': 'Dublin Children Services Building, Enable Ireland • Sandymount', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': 'Level 2 training builds on the foundation training of SeatTech Seating and Solutions Level 1 which provides an overview of general solutions for the more common seating and mobility presentations.

Suitable for everyone from complete novices to professional artists, you will take part in a mix of fun and relaxing practical exercises designed to bring greater presence, fulfilment and creativity to your everyday life.Being creative is incredibly beneficial to your mental health. As children we are given the space to explore and create every day - and this is an integral part of how we make sense of the world and manage our emotions growing up. As adults, we often don’t prioritise time for this. In this fun and informative workshop, we will revisit how to bring this sense of creativity and imagination back into your day to day, with the aim of encouraging more present, mindful living.In this workshop, we will be specifically focusing on the following concepts:MindfulnessFinding your innate creativity  “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.” - Pablo PicassoCreative flowJoyful living ‘Always leave enough time in your life to do something that makes you happy, satisfied, even joyous. That has more of an effect on economic wellbeing than any single factor.’Some examples of what we’ll be doing on the day:* Automatic drawing and writing* Creative paper crafting * Symbols and mandalas* Japanese HaikusAnd much more!Buzz from previous workshops:‘This is really great workshop to become more creative human being it learns how to overcome your fears, because of that this is very therapeutic and bring more joy in your life. I'm truly recommend it for people who would like get on with their live in much happier fashion.’ - Roman‘Did the creative course with Anne Marie and Shannon yesterday and truly enjoyed it!

But, you know there is more. You know there are deeper levels of understanding, deeper benefits and you want to experience them.During this level two workshop, that is exactly what you will learn.Introducing advanced breathingThe breathing practise has profound effects on us. We’ll be exploring new ways to use the breathing to change how we feel and think, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stress.Deeper cold exposureWe know that gradual exposure to the cold has many benefits, including strengthening our immune system, balancing our hormone levels and elevating our mood.Advanced focusUnderpinning all of this more advanced work, is improved focus and determination. Each step of the way, you will be gaining further mastery of your body and mind.  Who can attend this advanced training?People who have attended my fundamentals workshopsPeople who have completed the 10-week or fundamentals online coursesIf you have been practising the method consistently over a long period of timeBenefits of advanced trainingImproved health and moodIncreased knowledge of the method and yourself Engrain the method more deeply into your everyday lifeIt will give you practical tools that you can use to stay healthy and heal yourselfOpportunity to discuss your experiences of the method and learn from othersMore benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityFrequently asked questions What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching. If you like, bring a light blanket as people sometimes get cold when then are lying down during the breathing.Do I need to prepare for the workshop?Continue to practise the Wim Hof Method regularly. When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. Also, it will include a health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out. If you have done a workshop, or class, with us before, we’ll have your forms on file.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\"}, {'title': 'Founders Day 2019  - Exploring Anxiety and Mental Health', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tackle-your-feelings-aib-workshop-tickets-81468306899?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Free', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F80564725%2F211724879756%2F1%2Foriginal.20191112-112656?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C24%2C796%2C398&s=9acc2de2509f3bd9c9bd354b2d79405a', 'date': '3 December 2019', 'time': '', 'location': 'Presentation Room • Dublin', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': \"Tackle Your Feelings is hitting the road!
