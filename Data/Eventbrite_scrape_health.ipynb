Having realised as a young doctor that Irish women's reproductive lives were shaped by church and state, particularly by the Eighth Amendment, Boylan vowed to do what he could to change things. Throughout his forty year career, seven of these as Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Boylan has remained calm, measured and steadfast. As an obstetrician, he has attended the births of more than 6,000 babies and has seen women and families at their most vulnerable, their most joyous, and sometimes their most heart-broken. This memoir is at once a revealing behind-the-scenes insight into what it's like trying to make change happen and a fascinating, vital and encouraging portrait of a society in transition.\n",

A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. Plus, a light blanket - sometimes people get cold during the breathing exercises. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching.When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. In that will be a 20-day challenge. Don't worry: it will take less than a minute per day to complete! Also, health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out.The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\n",

      "In the Shadow of the Eighth is the story of Peter Boylan's life in medicine. Having realised as a young doctor that Irish women's reproductive lives were shaped by church and state, particularly by the Eighth Amendment, Boylan vowed to do what he could to change things. Throughout his forty year career, seven of these as Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Boylan has remained calm, measured and steadfast. As an obstetrician, he has attended the births of more than 6,000 babies and has seen women and families at their most vulnerable, their most joyous, and sometimes their most heart-broken. This memoir is at once a revealing behind-the-scenes insight into what it's like trying to make change happen and a fascinating, vital and encouraging portrait of a society in transition.\n",

Then, you’ll have the skills you need to live a healthier, happier and stronger life.Breathe fully and deeply, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stressImprove your focus and determination, helping you explore and eventually master your body and mindUse gradual exposure to the cold to strengthen your immune system, balance hormone levels and elevate your moodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityWelcome and registrationIntroduction to Wim Hof MethodBreathing exercisesStretching and breathingFocus and horse stanceIce bath!Warming up, teaQuestions and closing the workshopYou'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. Plus, a light blanket - sometimes people get cold during the breathing exercises. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching.When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. In that will be a 20-day challenge. Don't worry: it will take less than a minute per day to complete! Also, health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out.The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\n",

Having realised as a young doctor that Irish women's reproductive lives were shaped by church and state, particularly by the Eighth Amendment, Boylan vowed to do what he could to change things. Throughout his forty year career, seven of these as Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Boylan has remained calm, measured and steadfast. As an obstetrician, he has attended the births of more than 6,000 babies and has seen women and families at their most vulnerable, their most joyous, and sometimes their most heart-broken.

A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. Plus, a light blanket - sometimes people get cold during the breathing exercises. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching.When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. In that will be a 20-day challenge. Don't worry: it will take less than a minute per day to complete! Also, health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out.The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\"}, {'title': 'Future Health Summit 2020', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/future-health-summit-2020-tickets-62248803848?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €329.63', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F62694246%2F176078688942%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=392&auto=compress&rect=0%2C31%2C392%2C196&s=968e0939a32eb204fe95e99edd5a4f98', 'date': '20 May 2019', 'time': ' 2:00pm', 'location': 'Clyde Room, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': ' 20th & 21st May 2020Concert Hall, RDS, DublinCall 086 603 6525 or email robbie@investnet.ie for further details'}, {'title': 'Founders Day 2019  - Exploring Anxiety and Mental Health', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/founders-day-2019-exploring-anxiety-and-mental-health-tickets-69198926853?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €50.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F68629809%2F39177262496%2F1%2Foriginal.20190814-155143?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C0%2C1024%2C512&s=d156d9d68249287215a28c8138af48ad', 'date': '6 December 2019', 'time': ' 9:00am', 'location': \"Swift Lecture Theatre, St. Patrick's University Hospital, Dublin\", 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': \"Bringing together national and international academics, clinicians, and practitioners, Founder's Day is held to recognise and continue the legacy of St Patrick's founder, Jonathan Swift, a pioneer in mental healthcare.Taking place in St Patrick's University Hospital, Dublin 8, the 2019 conference focuses on the theme of anxiety.

A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. Plus, a light blanket - sometimes people get cold during the breathing exercises. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching.When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. In that will be a 20-day challenge. Don't worry: it will take less than a minute per day to complete! Also, health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out.The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\"}, {'title': 'Future Health Summit 2020', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/future-health-summit-2020-tickets-62248803848?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €329.63', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F62694246%2F176078688942%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=392&auto=compress&rect=0%2C31%2C392%2C196&s=968e0939a32eb204fe95e99edd5a4f98', 'date': '20 May 2019', 'time': ' 2:00pm', 'location': 'Clyde Room, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': ' 20th & 21st May 2020Concert Hall, RDS, DublinCall 086 603 6525 or email robbie@investnet.ie for further details'}]\n"

Haven't we all?I've been asking members of my Meetup Group: Practical Psychology (https://www.meetup.com/Practical-Psychology-Performance-Productivity-Wellbeing) what  topics they would like covered - and an overwhelming number of people responded asking for material on stress - and well....being overwhelmed.In response to my own stressed state, the member's requests, and the 'stressful' time of year (Merry Christmas!) - I've decided to put together a talk on stress.This one is a bit of an exploration for myself - so hopefully I can come up with some material not usually covered in stress talks.A couple of questions intrigued me about this topic..Why do two people in the same situation have different experiences in terms of stress?What should we do when we feel stressed?How do we know when we're stressed?I'll aim to tackle these questions, along with the basics of what stress is? Why it's so 'bad' for us. Why we get stressed. And what the hell to do about itThis is a huge topic - with a lot of highly esteemed scientists and practitioners having various opinions and strategies.I've also decide to explore 'dealing' with stress in 3 broad ways. Dealing with the physiological response, dealing with our perceptions of stressful situations and practically dealing with stressors (problem solving).Please RSVP as I'll need to set the venue for appropriate numbersSee you on December 3rdJayson\n",

      "Do any of your patients report leaking on sit to stand or with certain movements/exercise?Do any of your patients ever say that their prolapse symptoms are worse with standing, after walking or at the end of the day?Do you want to increase your confidence and skills to advance your internal assessments in positions and movements beyond just crook lying?Do you want to establish if what is found during vaginal examination in lying is really that different to what is found in standing or other functional movements?Do you want to set yourself apart as a physiotherapist who is truly empowering your clients to get to where they want to be?Then this is the course for you! Let’s face it, women do not spend their lives on their backs! This course will show you why we owe it to our female patients to be able to assess, and therefore treat, them in positions and movements that are applicable specifically to them. Adopting this approach sees greater patient compliance and more efficient treatment results.This unique functional pelvic floor assessment course is presented to you by Helen Keeble. Helen is an experienced and passionate pelvic health physiotherapist with a specialist interest in female sports. Helen has worked with many different types of female exercisers over the years, covering most disciplines. Helen spent 18 months of her career working inside a CrossFit gym assessing and treating female pelvic health complaints related to a huge variety of functional movements and positions (eg jumping, running, squatting and lifting) from all kinds of backgrounds; from the complete novice to the competing professional athlete. Helen currently works fully in private practice in Dublin and London and has been tutoring with the POGP since 2015.What you will learn from attending this course:- Why a standing or functional assessment of the female pelvic floor is beneficial and necessary addition to your toolkit- Functional assessment skills of the pelvic floor muscles that are transferable to females from ANY background - from nulliparous to multiparous, from the power lifter struggling to maintain continence at their maximum lift to the deconditioned female struggling with prolapse symptoms by the time it gets to midday.- The confidence to perform vaginal assessments in positions and movements other than crook lyingCourse schedule:9:45\tRegistration10:00  Welcome & Introduction10:15\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor (tutorial)11:45   Functional assessment of the female pelvic floor during standing (practical)13:30   Lunch14:00\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor during movement including sit to stand/squat and deadlift (practical)15:15   Refreshment break15:30   The pelvic floor during high impact & how to coach women back to this (tutorial)16:30\tCourse end In order to attend this course it is crucial that you are already trained in vaginal assessments and working within pelvic health. You do not, however, need to be versed in CrossFit, weight lifting or any other sport – the exercise element is just one arm of this course – the main focus is on function which is applicable to ALL patients.“As a keen exerciser, I need to know that my pelvic floor is functioning well in positions beyond just lying. That Helen could assess me in this way was a huge selling point for me.”\tTara, 37“As a novice power-lifter I had been having issues with leaking and deadlifts. I had been trying to figure it out myself by trying different bracing, belts and breathing techniques. Helen however was easily able to assess my pelvic floor during all different braces, breathing methods and during the deadlift! We quickly figured out the best strategy forward for me & this has been invaluable for my training.”\tJane, 50“I had noticed that my prolapse symptoms were only noticeable in standing or after a long walk. I hadn’t even heard of having a pelvic floor check in standing before but it added so much to my awareness of how to engage my muscles in this position. I am so much less aware now of my symptoms but more importantly, know exactly what to work on to improve them going forward”\tSarah, 39\n",

      "You have practised the Wim Hof Method for a while and can feel its potential. But, you know there is more. You know there are deeper levels of understanding, deeper benefits and you want to experience them.During this level two workshop, that is exactly what you will learn.Introducing advanced breathingThe breathing practise has profound effects on us. We’ll be exploring new ways to use the breathing to change how we feel and think, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stress.Deeper cold exposureWe know that gradual exposure to the cold has many benefits, including strengthening our immune system, balancing our hormone levels and elevating our mood.Advanced focusUnderpinning all of this more advanced work, is improved focus and determination. Each step of the way, you will be gaining further mastery of your body and mind.  Who can attend this advanced training?People who have attended my fundamentals workshopsPeople who have completed the 10-week or fundamentals online coursesIf you have been practising the method consistently over a long period of timeBenefits of advanced trainingImproved health and moodIncreased knowledge of the method and yourself Engrain the method more deeply into your everyday lifeIt will give you practical tools that you can use to stay healthy and heal yourselfOpportunity to discuss your experiences of the method and learn from othersMore benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityFrequently asked questions What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching. If you like, bring a light blanket as people sometimes get cold when then are lying down during the breathing.Do I need to prepare for the workshop?Continue to practise the Wim Hof Method regularly. When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. Also, it will include a health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out. If you have done a workshop, or class, with us before, we’ll have your forms on file.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\n",

A law dictated by the rules of life and more importantly our minds and how it works. To make beneficial changes in our lives, both on a mental capacity and also a physical and practical level, we want to implement these steps in this way to reach that success.Whether you want to have more focus, clarity, peace of mind or happiness, there is a specific way and program to address this in the best way.There is also an easier way to create deeper and more authentic relationships in both business or your personal life, by communicating in the most effective way.And yes, there is a way to communicate with yourself more beneficially also. A way to still and quiet that unruly mind and turn it into a tool for your mastering more success, happiness and fulfilment.The acclaimed self development book, The BlackBelt MasterMind by Danielle Serpico, outlines these steps.

Haven't we all?I've been asking members of my Meetup Group: Practical Psychology (https://www.meetup.com/Practical-Psychology-Performance-Productivity-Wellbeing) what  topics they would like covered - and an overwhelming number of people responded asking for material on stress - and well....being overwhelmed.In response to my own stressed state, the member's requests, and the 'stressful' time of year (Merry Christmas!) - I've decided to put together a talk on stress.This one is a bit of an exploration for myself - so hopefully I can come up with some material not usually covered in stress talks.A couple of questions intrigued me about this topic..Why do two people in the same situation have different experiences in terms of stress?What should we do when we feel stressed?How do we know when we're stressed?I'll aim to tackle these questions, along with the basics of what stress is? Why it's so 'bad' for us. Why we get stressed. And what the hell to do about itThis is a huge topic - with a lot of highly esteemed scientists and practitioners having various opinions and strategies.I've also decide to explore 'dealing' with stress in 3 broad ways. Dealing with the physiological response, dealing with our perceptions of stressful situations and practically dealing with stressors (problem solving).Please RSVP as I'll need to set the venue for appropriate numbersSee you on December 3rdJayson\n",

      "Do any of your patients report leaking on sit to stand or with certain movements/exercise?Do any of your patients ever say that their prolapse symptoms are worse with standing, after walking or at the end of the day?Do you want to increase your confidence and skills to advance your internal assessments in positions and movements beyond just crook lying?Do you want to establish if what is found during vaginal examination in lying is really that different to what is found in standing or other functional movements?Do you want to set yourself apart as a physiotherapist who is truly empowering your clients to get to where they want to be?Then this is the course for you! Let’s face it, women do not spend their lives on their backs! This course will show you why we owe it to our female patients to be able to assess, and therefore treat, them in positions and movements that are applicable specifically to them. Adopting this approach sees greater patient compliance and more efficient treatment results.This unique functional pelvic floor assessment course is presented to you by Helen Keeble. Helen is an experienced and passionate pelvic health physiotherapist with a specialist interest in female sports. Helen has worked with many different types of female exercisers over the years, covering most disciplines. Helen spent 18 months of her career working inside a CrossFit gym assessing and treating female pelvic health complaints related to a huge variety of functional movements and positions (eg jumping, running, squatting and lifting) from all kinds of backgrounds; from the complete novice to the competing professional athlete. Helen currently works fully in private practice in Dublin and London and has been tutoring with the POGP since 2015.What you will learn from attending this course:- Why a standing or functional assessment of the female pelvic floor is beneficial and necessary addition to your toolkit- Functional assessment skills of the pelvic floor muscles that are transferable to females from ANY background - from nulliparous to multiparous, from the power lifter struggling to maintain continence at their maximum lift to the deconditioned female struggling with prolapse symptoms by the time it gets to midday.- The confidence to perform vaginal assessments in positions and movements other than crook lyingCourse schedule:9:45\tRegistration10:00  Welcome & Introduction10:15\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor (tutorial)11:45   Functional assessment of the female pelvic floor during standing (practical)13:30   Lunch14:00\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor during movement including sit to stand/squat and deadlift (practical)15:15   Refreshment break15:30   The pelvic floor during high impact & how to coach women back to this (tutorial)16:30\tCourse end In order to attend this course it is crucial that you are already trained in vaginal assessments and working within pelvic health. You do not, however, need to be versed in CrossFit, weight lifting or any other sport – the exercise element is just one arm of this course – the main focus is on function which is applicable to ALL patients.“As a keen exerciser, I need to know that my pelvic floor is functioning well in positions beyond just lying. That Helen could assess me in this way was a huge selling point for me.”\tTara, 37“As a novice power-lifter I had been having issues with leaking and deadlifts. I had been trying to figure it out myself by trying different bracing, belts and breathing techniques. Helen however was easily able to assess my pelvic floor during all different braces, breathing methods and during the deadlift! We quickly figured out the best strategy forward for me & this has been invaluable for my training.”\tJane, 50“I had noticed that my prolapse symptoms were only noticeable in standing or after a long walk. I hadn’t even heard of having a pelvic floor check in standing before but it added so much to my awareness of how to engage my muscles in this position. I am so much less aware now of my symptoms but more importantly, know exactly what to work on to improve them going forward”\tSarah, 39\n",

      "You have practised the Wim Hof Method for a while and can feel its potential. But, you know there is more. You know there are deeper levels of understanding, deeper benefits and you want to experience them.During this level two workshop, that is exactly what you will learn.Introducing advanced breathingThe breathing practise has profound effects on us. We’ll be exploring new ways to use the breathing to change how we feel and think, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stress.Deeper cold exposureWe know that gradual exposure to the cold has many benefits, including strengthening our immune system, balancing our hormone levels and elevating our mood.Advanced focusUnderpinning all of this more advanced work, is improved focus and determination. Each step of the way, you will be gaining further mastery of your body and mind.  Who can attend this advanced training?People who have attended my fundamentals workshopsPeople who have completed the 10-week or fundamentals online coursesIf you have been practising the method consistently over a long period of timeBenefits of advanced trainingImproved health and moodIncreased knowledge of the method and yourself Engrain the method more deeply into your everyday lifeIt will give you practical tools that you can use to stay healthy and heal yourselfOpportunity to discuss your experiences of the method and learn from othersMore benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityFrequently asked questions What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching. If you like, bring a light blanket as people sometimes get cold when then are lying down during the breathing.Do I need to prepare for the workshop?Continue to practise the Wim Hof Method regularly. When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. Also, it will include a health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out. If you have done a workshop, or class, with us before, we’ll have your forms on file.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\n",

      "\"What you think, you become.\" - Buddha (In aid of Edel Kennedy - details at bottom of page)Based on the concepts and principles taken from  the MASTER System,  a universal concept with its roots in psychology, neuro- reprogramming, hypnosis, nlp, mindfulness, sport & business psychology and common practical sense.The basis is that whether we want to change ourselves or others, there is a common law outlining these steps. A law dictated by the rules of life and more importantly our minds and how it works. To make beneficial changes in our lives, both on a mental capacity and also a physical and practical level, we want to implement these steps in this way to reach that success.Whether you want to have more focus, clarity, peace of mind or happiness, there is a specific way and program to address this in the best way.There is also an easier way to create deeper and more authentic relationships in both business or your personal life, by communicating in the most effective way.And yes, there is a way to communicate with yourself more beneficially also. A way to still and quiet that unruly mind and turn it into a tool for your mastering more success, happiness and fulfilment.The acclaimed self development book, The BlackBelt MasterMind by Danielle Serpico, outlines these steps.

A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. Plus, a light blanket - sometimes people get cold during the breathing exercises. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching.When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. In that will be a 20-day challenge. Don't worry: it will take less than a minute per day to complete! Also, health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out.The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\"}, {'title': 'Future Health Summit 2020', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/future-health-summit-2020-tickets-62248803848?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €329.63', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F62694246%2F176078688942%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=392&auto=compress&rect=0%2C31%2C392%2C196&s=968e0939a32eb204fe95e99edd5a4f98', 'date': '20 May 2019', 'time': ' 2:00pm', 'location': 'Clyde Room, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': ' 20th & 21st May 2020Concert Hall, RDS, DublinCall 086 603 6525 or email robbie@investnet.ie for further details'}, {'title': 'Founders Day 2019  - Exploring Anxiety and Mental Health', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/founders-day-2019-exploring-anxiety-and-mental-health-tickets-69198926853?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €50.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F68629809%2F39177262496%2F1%2Foriginal.20190814-155143?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C0%2C1024%2C512&s=d156d9d68249287215a28c8138af48ad', 'date': '6 December 2019', 'time': ' 9:00am', 'location': \"Swift Lecture Theatre, St. Patrick's University Hospital, Dublin\", 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': \"Bringing together national and international academics, clinicians, and practitioners, Founder's Day is held to recognise and continue the legacy of St Patrick's founder, Jonathan Swift, a pioneer in mental healthcare.Taking place in St Patrick's University Hospital, Dublin 8, the 2019 conference focuses on the theme of anxiety.

A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. Plus, a light blanket - sometimes people get cold during the breathing exercises. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching.When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. In that will be a 20-day challenge. Don't worry: it will take less than a minute per day to complete! Also, health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out.The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force.

Let’s face it, women do not spend their lives on their backs! This course will show you why we owe it to our female patients to be able to assess, and therefore treat, them in positions and movements that are applicable specifically to them. Adopting this approach sees greater patient compliance and more efficient treatment results.This unique functional pelvic floor assessment course is presented to you by Helen Keeble. Helen is an experienced and passionate pelvic health physiotherapist with a specialist interest in female sports. Helen has worked with many different types of female exercisers over the years, covering most disciplines. Helen spent 18 months of her career working inside a CrossFit gym assessing and treating female pelvic health complaints related to a huge variety of functional movements and positions (eg jumping, running, squatting and lifting) from all kinds of backgrounds; from the complete novice to the competing professional athlete. Helen currently works fully in private practice in Dublin and London and has been tutoring with the POGP since 2015.What you will learn from attending this course:- Why a standing or functional assessment of the female pelvic floor is beneficial and necessary addition to your toolkit- Functional assessment skills of the pelvic floor muscles that are transferable to females from ANY background - from nulliparous to multiparous, from the power lifter struggling to maintain continence at their maximum lift to the deconditioned female struggling with prolapse symptoms by the time it gets to midday.- The confidence to perform vaginal assessments in positions and movements other than crook lyingCourse schedule:9:45\\tRegistration10:00  Welcome & Introduction10:15\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor (tutorial)11:45   Functional assessment of the female pelvic floor during standing (practical)13:30   Lunch14:00\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor during movement including sit to stand/squat and deadlift (practical)15:15   Refreshment break15:30   The pelvic floor during high impact & how to coach women back to this (tutorial)16:30\\tCourse end In order to attend this course it is crucial that you are already trained in vaginal assessments and working within pelvic health. You do not, however, need to be versed in CrossFit, weight lifting or any other sport – the exercise element is just one arm of this course – the main focus is on function which is applicable to ALL patients.“As a keen exerciser, I need to know that my pelvic floor is functioning well in positions beyond just lying. That Helen could assess me in this way was a huge selling point for me.”\\tTara, 37“As a novice power-lifter I had been having issues with leaking and deadlifts. I had been trying to figure it out myself by trying different bracing, belts and breathing techniques. Helen however was easily able to assess my pelvic floor during all different braces, breathing methods and during the deadlift! We quickly figured out the best strategy forward for me & this has been invaluable for my training.”\\tJane, 50“I had noticed that my prolapse symptoms were only noticeable in standing or after a long walk. I hadn’t even heard of having a pelvic floor check in standing before but it added so much to my awareness of how to engage my muscles in this position. I am so much less aware now of my symptoms but more importantly, know exactly what to work on to improve them going forward”\\tSarah, 39'}, {'title': 'Breathe With Níall workshop - Level Two ', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/breathe-with-niall-workshop-level-two-tickets-69583218279?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €95.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F68989571%2F203215153752%2F1%2Foriginal.20190201-171430?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C140%2C816%2C408&s=7d6e20247495570507f83d0ca9354a14', 'date': '30 November 2019', 'time': ' 10:30am', 'location': 'Booterstown Community and Arts Centre', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': \"You have practised the Wim Hof Method for a while and can feel its potential. But, you know there is more. You know there are deeper levels of understanding, deeper benefits and you want to experience them.During this level two workshop, that is exactly what you will learn.Introducing advanced breathingThe breathing practise has profound effects on us. We’ll be exploring new ways to use the breathing to change how we feel and think, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stress.Deeper cold exposureWe know that gradual exposure to the cold has many benefits, including strengthening our immune system, balancing our hormone levels and elevating our mood.Advanced focusUnderpinning all of this more advanced work, is improved focus and determination. Each step of the way, you will be gaining further mastery of your body and mind.  Who can attend this advanced training?People who have attended my fundamentals workshopsPeople who have completed the 10-week or fundamentals online coursesIf you have been practising the method consistently over a long period of timeBenefits of advanced trainingImproved health and moodIncreased knowledge of the method and yourself Engrain the method more deeply into your everyday lifeIt will give you practical tools that you can use to stay healthy and heal yourselfOpportunity to discuss your experiences of the method and learn from othersMore benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityFrequently asked questions What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching. If you like, bring a light blanket as people sometimes get cold when then are lying down during the breathing.Do I need to prepare for the workshop?Continue to practise the Wim Hof Method regularly. When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. Also, it will include a health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out. If you have done a workshop, or class, with us before, we’ll have your forms on file.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\"}, {'title': \"The MASTER'ing Your Mind Conference\", 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/the-mastering-your-mind-conference-tickets-69628269027?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €100.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F69017139%2F96799428801%2F1%2Foriginal.20190818-112702?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C13%2C1920%2C960&s=440e49b3652edf9df017906b1516aec5', 'date': '25 January 2019', 'time': ' 10:00am', 'location': 'Hilton Hotel , Dublin', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': '\"What you think, you become.\" - Buddha (In aid of Edel Kennedy - details at bottom of page)Based on the concepts and principles taken from  the MASTER System,  a universal concept with its roots in psychology, neuro- reprogramming, hypnosis, nlp, mindfulness, sport & business psychology and common practical sense.The basis is that whether we want to change ourselves or others, there is a common law outlining these steps.

Why it's so 'bad' for us. Why we get stressed. And what the hell to do about itThis is a huge topic - with a lot of highly esteemed scientists and practitioners having various opinions and strategies.I've also decide to explore 'dealing' with stress in 3 broad ways. Dealing with the physiological response, dealing with our perceptions of stressful situations and practically dealing with stressors (problem solving).Please RSVP as I'll need to set the venue for appropriate numbersSee you on December 3rdJayson\"}, {'title': 'Connect Out - Restorative Facilitator (Circles)', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/connect-out-restorative-facilitator-circles-tickets-68293191775?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €152.74', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F67878179%2F271660828954%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C49%2C986%2C493&s=5736d1d78a7ea3c0ef4d7010762f80d8', 'date': '23 November 2019', 'time': ' 9:30am', 'location': 'Drumcondra Education Centre, Drumcondra', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': 'During this one day Saturday workshop, we build on our existing skills from Connect In and expand our capacity to facilitate restorative practices with groups.

Let’s face it, women do not spend their lives on their backs! This course will show you why we owe it to our female patients to be able to assess, and therefore treat, them in positions and movements that are applicable specifically to them. Adopting this approach sees greater patient compliance and more efficient treatment results.This unique functional pelvic floor assessment course is presented to you by Helen Keeble. Helen is an experienced and passionate pelvic health physiotherapist with a specialist interest in female sports. Helen has worked with many different types of female exercisers over the years, covering most disciplines. Helen spent 18 months of her career working inside a CrossFit gym assessing and treating female pelvic health complaints related to a huge variety of functional movements and positions (eg jumping, running, squatting and lifting) from all kinds of backgrounds; from the complete novice to the competing professional athlete. Helen currently works fully in private practice in Dublin and London and has been tutoring with the POGP since 2015.What you will learn from attending this course:- Why a standing or functional assessment of the female pelvic floor is beneficial and necessary addition to your toolkit- Functional assessment skills of the pelvic floor muscles that are transferable to females from ANY background - from nulliparous to multiparous, from the power lifter struggling to maintain continence at their maximum lift to the deconditioned female struggling with prolapse symptoms by the time it gets to midday.- The confidence to perform vaginal assessments in positions and movements other than crook lyingCourse schedule:9:45\\tRegistration10:00  Welcome & Introduction10:15\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor (tutorial)11:45   Functional assessment of the female pelvic floor during standing (practical)13:30   Lunch14:00\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor during movement including sit to stand/squat and deadlift (practical)15:15   Refreshment break15:30   The pelvic floor during high impact & how to coach women back to this (tutorial)16:30\\tCourse end In order to attend this course it is crucial that you are already trained in vaginal assessments and working within pelvic health. You do not, however, need to be versed in CrossFit, weight lifting or any other sport – the exercise element is just one arm of this course – the main focus is on function which is applicable to ALL patients.“As a keen exerciser, I need to know that my pelvic floor is functioning well in positions beyond just lying. That Helen could assess me in this way was a huge selling point for me.”\\tTara, 37“As a novice power-lifter I had been having issues with leaking and deadlifts. I had been trying to figure it out myself by trying different bracing, belts and breathing techniques. Helen however was easily able to assess my pelvic floor during all different braces, breathing methods and during the deadlift! We quickly figured out the best strategy forward for me & this has been invaluable for my training.”\\tJane, 50“I had noticed that my prolapse symptoms were only noticeable in standing or after a long walk. I hadn’t even heard of having a pelvic floor check in standing before but it added so much to my awareness of how to engage my muscles in this position. I am so much less aware now of my symptoms but more importantly, know exactly what to work on to improve them going forward”\\tSarah, 39'}, {'title': 'Breathe With Níall workshop - Level Two ', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/breathe-with-niall-workshop-level-two-tickets-69583218279?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €95.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F68989571%2F203215153752%2F1%2Foriginal.20190201-171430?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C140%2C816%2C408&s=7d6e20247495570507f83d0ca9354a14', 'date': '30 November 2019', 'time': ' 10:30am', 'location': 'Booterstown Community and Arts Centre', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': \"You have practised the Wim Hof Method for a while and can feel its potential. But, you know there is more. You know there are deeper levels of understanding, deeper benefits and you want to experience them.During this level two workshop, that is exactly what you will learn.Introducing advanced breathingThe breathing practise has profound effects on us. We’ll be exploring new ways to use the breathing to change how we feel and think, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stress.Deeper cold exposureWe know that gradual exposure to the cold has many benefits, including strengthening our immune system, balancing our hormone levels and elevating our mood.Advanced focusUnderpinning all of this more advanced work, is improved focus and determination. Each step of the way, you will be gaining further mastery of your body and mind.  Who can attend this advanced training?People who have attended my fundamentals workshopsPeople who have completed the 10-week or fundamentals online coursesIf you have been practising the method consistently over a long period of timeBenefits of advanced trainingImproved health and moodIncreased knowledge of the method and yourself Engrain the method more deeply into your everyday lifeIt will give you practical tools that you can use to stay healthy and heal yourselfOpportunity to discuss your experiences of the method and learn from othersMore benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityFrequently asked questions What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching. If you like, bring a light blanket as people sometimes get cold when then are lying down during the breathing.Do I need to prepare for the workshop?Continue to practise the Wim Hof Method regularly. When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. Also, it will include a health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out. If you have done a workshop, or class, with us before, we’ll have your forms on file.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force.

Thousands of community health workers and members of the HIV and key population networks – many of whom are living with HIV or affected by the epidemic – contributed to this success.Global leaders recognised the essential role that communities play in ending AIDS and achieving health for all in the first-ever UN declaration on universal health coverage and the “Global action plan for healthy lives and well-being for all”, approved by Member States in September 2019.On World AIDS Day 2019, WHO is highlighting the difference these communities are making to end HIV while drawing global attention to the need for broader engagement with them to strengthen primary health care.On December 3rd, the EDI Unit invites you to meet the community making a difference in Ireland: Robbie Lawlor, activist and co-founder of Access to Medicines Ireland;  Prof Samuel  McConkey, Associate Professor and Head of the Department of International Health and Tropical Medicine at RCSI;  Erin Nugent, Community Support Manager at HIV Ireland;Dr Elena Vaughan, Health Promotion Research Centre, NUI Galway;Tonie Walsh, Independent curator of Irish Queer Archive.

The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.” - Pablo PicassoCreative flowJoyful living ‘Always leave enough time in your life to do something that makes you happy, satisfied, even joyous.

Thousands of community health workers and members of the HIV and key population networks – many of whom are living with HIV or affected by the epidemic – contributed to this success.Global leaders recognised the essential role that communities play in ending AIDS and achieving health for all in the first-ever UN declaration on universal health coverage and the “Global action plan for healthy lives and well-being for all”, approved by Member States in September 2019.On World AIDS Day 2019, WHO is highlighting the difference these communities are making to end HIV while drawing global attention to the need for broader engagement with them to strengthen primary health care.On December 3rd, the EDI Unit invites you to meet the community making a difference in Ireland: Robbie Lawlor, activist and co-founder of Access to Medicines Ireland;  Prof Samuel  McConkey, Associate Professor and Head of the Department of International Health and Tropical Medicine at RCSI;  Erin Nugent, Community Support Manager at HIV Ireland;Dr Elena Vaughan, Health Promotion Research Centre, NUI Galway;Tonie Walsh, Independent curator of Irish Queer Archive.

A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. Plus, a light blanket - sometimes people get cold during the breathing exercises. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching.When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. In that will be a 20-day challenge. Don't worry: it will take less than a minute per day to complete! Also, health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out.The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\"}, {'title': 'Future Health Summit 2020', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/future-health-summit-2020-tickets-62248803848?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €329.63', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F62694246%2F176078688942%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=392&auto=compress&rect=0%2C31%2C392%2C196&s=968e0939a32eb204fe95e99edd5a4f98', 'date': '20 May 2019', 'time': ' 2:00pm', 'location': 'Clyde Room, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': ' 20th & 21st May 2020Concert Hall, RDS, DublinCall 086 603 6525 or email robbie@investnet.ie for further details'}, {'title': 'Founders Day 2019  - Exploring Anxiety and Mental Health', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/founders-day-2019-exploring-anxiety-and-mental-health-tickets-69198926853?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €50.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F68629809%2F39177262496%2F1%2Foriginal.20190814-155143?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C0%2C1024%2C512&s=d156d9d68249287215a28c8138af48ad', 'date': '6 December 2019', 'time': ' 9:00am', 'location': \"Swift Lecture Theatre, St. Patrick's University Hospital, Dublin\", 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': \"Bringing together national and international academics, clinicians, and practitioners, Founder's Day is held to recognise and continue the legacy of St Patrick's founder, Jonathan Swift, a pioneer in mental healthcare.Taking place in St Patrick's University Hospital, Dublin 8, the 2019 conference focuses on the theme of anxiety.

A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. Plus, a light blanket - sometimes people get cold during the breathing exercises. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching.When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. In that will be a 20-day challenge. Don't worry: it will take less than a minute per day to complete! Also, health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out.The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\"}, {'title': 'Future Health Summit 2020', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/future-health-summit-2020-tickets-62248803848?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €329.63', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F62694246%2F176078688942%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=392&auto=compress&rect=0%2C31%2C392%2C196&s=968e0939a32eb204fe95e99edd5a4f98', 'date': '20 May 2019', 'time': ' 2:00pm', 'location': 'Clyde Room, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': ' 20th & 21st May 2020Concert Hall, RDS, DublinCall 086 603 6525 or email robbie@investnet.ie for further details'}, {'title': 'Spike Milligan Public Speaking Competition 2019', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/spike-milligan-public-speaking-competition-2019-registration-77801148329?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Free', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F77731445%2F324861064915%2F1%2Foriginal.20191022-110933?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C0%2C2160%2C1080&s=ba6f1eeb1f652345dfdc241bf67011db', 'date': '21 November 2019', 'time': ' 6:00pm', 'location': 'The Button Factory, Dublin', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': 'The Spike Milligan Public Speaking Competition is an All-Ireland Intervarsity Competition for medical students which aims to foster the development of communication skills and mental health awareness, all while carrying on Spike Milligan\\'s legacy of destigmatising mental illness.

Why it's so 'bad' for us. Why we get stressed.

Let’s face it, women do not spend their lives on their backs! This course will show you why we owe it to our female patients to be able to assess, and therefore treat, them in positions and movements that are applicable specifically to them. Adopting this approach sees greater patient compliance and more efficient treatment results.This unique functional pelvic floor assessment course is presented to you by Helen Keeble. Helen is an experienced and passionate pelvic health physiotherapist with a specialist interest in female sports. Helen has worked with many different types of female exercisers over the years, covering most disciplines. Helen spent 18 months of her career working inside a CrossFit gym assessing and treating female pelvic health complaints related to a huge variety of functional movements and positions (eg jumping, running, squatting and lifting) from all kinds of backgrounds; from the complete novice to the competing professional athlete. Helen currently works fully in private practice in Dublin and London and has been tutoring with the POGP since 2015.What you will learn from attending this course:- Why a standing or functional assessment of the female pelvic floor is beneficial and necessary addition to your toolkit- Functional assessment skills of the pelvic floor muscles that are transferable to females from ANY background - from nulliparous to multiparous, from the power lifter struggling to maintain continence at their maximum lift to the deconditioned female struggling with prolapse symptoms by the time it gets to midday.- The confidence to perform vaginal assessments in positions and movements other than crook lyingCourse schedule:9:45\\tRegistration10:00  Welcome & Introduction10:15\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor (tutorial)11:45   Functional assessment of the female pelvic floor during standing (practical)13:30   Lunch14:00\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor during movement including sit to stand/squat and deadlift (practical)15:15   Refreshment break15:30   The pelvic floor during high impact & how to coach women back to this (tutorial)16:30\\tCourse end In order to attend this course it is crucial that you are already trained in vaginal assessments and working within pelvic health. You do not, however, need to be versed in CrossFit, weight lifting or any other sport – the exercise element is just one arm of this course – the main focus is on function which is applicable to ALL patients.“As a keen exerciser, I need to know that my pelvic floor is functioning well in positions beyond just lying. That Helen could assess me in this way was a huge selling point for me.”\\tTara, 37“As a novice power-lifter I had been having issues with leaking and deadlifts. I had been trying to figure it out myself by trying different bracing, belts and breathing techniques. Helen however was easily able to assess my pelvic floor during all different braces, breathing methods and during the deadlift!

I hadn’t even heard of having a pelvic floor check in standing before but it added so much to my awareness of how to engage my muscles in this position.

But, you know there is more. You know there are deeper levels of understanding, deeper benefits and you want to experience them.During this level two workshop, that is exactly what you will learn.Introducing advanced breathingThe breathing practise has profound effects on us. We’ll be exploring new ways to use the breathing to change how we feel and think, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stress.Deeper cold exposureWe know that gradual exposure to the cold has many benefits, including strengthening our immune system, balancing our hormone levels and elevating our mood.Advanced focusUnderpinning all of this more advanced work, is improved focus and determination. Each step of the way, you will be gaining further mastery of your body and mind.  Who can attend this advanced training?People who have attended my fundamentals workshopsPeople who have completed the 10-week or fundamentals online coursesIf you have been practising the method consistently over a long period of timeBenefits of advanced trainingImproved health and moodIncreased knowledge of the method and yourself Engrain the method more deeply into your everyday lifeIt will give you practical tools that you can use to stay healthy and heal yourselfOpportunity to discuss your experiences of the method and learn from othersMore benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityFrequently asked questions What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching. If you like, bring a light blanket as people sometimes get cold when then are lying down during the breathing.Do I need to prepare for the workshop?Continue to practise the Wim Hof Method regularly. When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. Also, it will include a health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out. If you have done a workshop, or class, with us before, we’ll have your forms on file.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\"}, {'title': \"The MASTER'ing Your Mind Conference\", 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/the-mastering-your-mind-conference-tickets-69628269027?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €100.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F69017139%2F96799428801%2F1%2Foriginal.20190818-112702?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C13%2C1920%2C960&s=440e49b3652edf9df017906b1516aec5', 'date': '25 January 2019', 'time': ' 10:00am', 'location': 'Hilton Hotel , Dublin', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': '\"What you think, you become.\" - Buddha (In aid of Edel Kennedy - details at bottom of page)Based on the concepts and principles taken from  the MASTER System,  a universal concept with its roots in psychology, neuro- reprogramming, hypnosis, nlp, mindfulness, sport & business psychology and common practical sense.The basis is that whether we want to change ourselves or others, there is a common law outlining these steps.

Let’s face it, women do not spend their lives on their backs! This course will show you why we owe it to our female patients to be able to assess, and therefore treat, them in positions and movements that are applicable specifically to them. Adopting this approach sees greater patient compliance and more efficient treatment results.This unique functional pelvic floor assessment course is presented to you by Helen Keeble. Helen is an experienced and passionate pelvic health physiotherapist with a specialist interest in female sports. Helen has worked with many different types of female exercisers over the years, covering most disciplines. Helen spent 18 months of her career working inside a CrossFit gym assessing and treating female pelvic health complaints related to a huge variety of functional movements and positions (eg jumping, running, squatting and lifting) from all kinds of backgrounds; from the complete novice to the competing professional athlete. Helen currently works fully in private practice in Dublin and London and has been tutoring with the POGP since 2015.What you will learn from attending this course:- Why a standing or functional assessment of the female pelvic floor is beneficial and necessary addition to your toolkit- Functional assessment skills of the pelvic floor muscles that are transferable to females from ANY background - from nulliparous to multiparous, from the power lifter struggling to maintain continence at their maximum lift to the deconditioned female struggling with prolapse symptoms by the time it gets to midday.- The confidence to perform vaginal assessments in positions and movements other than crook lyingCourse schedule:9:45\\tRegistration10:00  Welcome & Introduction10:15\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor (tutorial)11:45   Functional assessment of the female pelvic floor during standing (practical)13:30   Lunch14:00\\tFunctional assessment of the female pelvic floor during movement including sit to stand/squat and deadlift (practical)15:15   Refreshment break15:30   The pelvic floor during high impact & how to coach women back to this (tutorial)16:30\\tCourse end In order to attend this course it is crucial that you are already trained in vaginal assessments and working within pelvic health. You do not, however, need to be versed in CrossFit, weight lifting or any other sport – the exercise element is just one arm of this course – the main focus is on function which is applicable to ALL patients.“As a keen exerciser, I need to know that my pelvic floor is functioning well in positions beyond just lying. That Helen could assess me in this way was a huge selling point for me.”\\tTara, 37“As a novice power-lifter I had been having issues with leaking and deadlifts. I had been trying to figure it out myself by trying different bracing, belts and breathing techniques. Helen however was easily able to assess my pelvic floor during all different braces, breathing methods and during the deadlift! We quickly figured out the best strategy forward for me & this has been invaluable for my training.”\\tJane, 50“I had noticed that my prolapse symptoms were only noticeable in standing or after a long walk. I hadn’t even heard of having a pelvic floor check in standing before but it added so much to my awareness of how to engage my muscles in this position. I am so much less aware now of my symptoms but more importantly, know exactly what to work on to improve them going forward”\\tSarah, 39'}, {'title': 'Breathe With Níall workshop - Level Two ', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/breathe-with-niall-workshop-level-two-tickets-69583218279?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €95.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F68989571%2F203215153752%2F1%2Foriginal.20190201-171430?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C140%2C816%2C408&s=7d6e20247495570507f83d0ca9354a14', 'date': '30 November 2019', 'time': ' 10:30am', 'location': 'Booterstown Community and Arts Centre', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': \"You have practised the Wim Hof Method for a while and can feel its potential.

We’ll be exploring new ways to use the breathing to change how we feel and think, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stress.Deeper cold exposureWe know that gradual exposure to the cold has many benefits, including strengthening our immune system, balancing our hormone levels and elevating our mood.Advanced focusUnderpinning all of this more advanced work, is improved focus and determination. Each step of the way, you will be gaining further mastery of your body and mind.  Who can attend this advanced training?People who have attended my fundamentals workshopsPeople who have completed the 10-week or fundamentals online coursesIf you have been practising the method consistently over a long period of timeBenefits of advanced trainingImproved health and moodIncreased knowledge of the method and yourself Engrain the method more deeply into your everyday lifeIt will give you practical tools that you can use to stay healthy and heal yourselfOpportunity to discuss your experiences of the method and learn from othersMore benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativityFrequently asked questions What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching. If you like, bring a light blanket as people sometimes get cold when then are lying down during the breathing.Do I need to prepare for the workshop?Continue to practise the Wim Hof Method regularly. When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. Also, it will include a health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out. If you have done a workshop, or class, with us before, we’ll have your forms on file.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\"}, {'title': \"The MASTER'ing Your Mind Conference\", 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/the-mastering-your-mind-conference-tickets-69628269027?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Starts at €100.00', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F69017139%2F96799428801%2F1%2Foriginal.20190818-112702?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C13%2C1920%2C960&s=440e49b3652edf9df017906b1516aec5', 'date': '25 January 2019', 'time': ' 10:00am', 'location': 'Hilton Hotel , Dublin', 'category': 'HEALTH & SPORTS', 'description': '\"What you think, you become.\" - Buddha (In aid of Edel Kennedy - details at bottom of page)Based on the concepts and principles taken from  the MASTER System,  a universal concept with its roots in psychology, neuro- reprogramming, hypnosis, nlp, mindfulness, sport & business psychology and common practical sense.The basis is that whether we want to change ourselves or others, there is a common law outlining these steps.

A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. Plus, a light blanket - sometimes people get cold during the breathing exercises. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching.When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. In that will be a 20-day challenge. Don't worry: it will take less than a minute per day to complete! Also, health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out.The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method.\n",

      "This immersive workshop will offer you the possibility to experience a deep connection to your body and voice through developmental somatic movement and sound. From that place of connection to your \"Self\" you will be invited to project your embodied experience through art making and image making with objects. Then you will be guided into a playful exploration of the different parts that make up your social self, inviting those different characters to gently be embodied, to be playful, to speak their truth. Then we will connect to the Self with capital S, the essence in us that is not shaped by our parts, and that we can call the soul, the heart, the expression of our true nature, the compassionate and loving Self. The Self will invite the parts to a dance of recognition, perhaps a letting go of what does not serve you any more or a moment of gratitude for what they offer us.   The session will include :•\tGuided meditation and breath work•\tSomatic movement practice•\tThe embodiment of voice•\tConnecting to the Self•\tProjecting the experience•\tPersonal choreography with objects: projecting Parts•\tEmbodying the Parts •\tThe dance of the Parts and the Self  •\tConnecting to the SelfAimed at movement practitioners, therapists, artists, creative facilitators... and anyone with an interest in exploring the arts as a tool to raise personal awareness and consciousness levels.

There is an immediate sensation of safety and comfort once entering this nourishing, wholesome, sacred and held space. This safe space is built upon, brick by brick, moment by moment,  with the most extraordinary patience, talent, care, instinct, therapuetical holding, artistic creativity and talent within Marianne’s facilitation. One and all feel welcome, nourished, heard, seen, loved, and invited to explore what one feels comfortable to explore in a sanctity of play, exploration, and creativity. This multi-faceted form and style of work is very rare in Dublin, like a beacon of light constantly shining out to the World beyond. It is individually rewarding on so many levels, and you will leave with a great sense of self-nourishment and part of an ensemble where each participant and the ensemble is seen. Witnessed. Held. Nourished. Empowered.  One partakes in, and with an ensemble, in the true meaning of the word and World. — Michael. I really enjoyed the special day at Dramatherapy Company.

      "Are you stressed? Tired? Sick?Or, looking for a competitive advantage?You can transform how you feel, how you think and your health by learning the Wim Hof Method. I can teach you. Then, you’ll have the skills you need to live a healthier, happier and stronger life.You'll learn how to:Breathe fully and deeply, improving your health, giving you more energy and reducing stressImprove your focus and determination, helping you explore and eventually master your body and mindUse gradual exposure to the cold to strengthen your immune system, balance hormone levels and elevate your mood More benefits of learning the Wim Hof MethodIncreased energyBetter SleepHeightened focus and determinationImproved sports performanceReduced stress levelsGreater cold toleranceFaster recoveryEnhanced creativity Schedule for the workshopWelcome and registrationIntroduction to Wim Hof Method Breathing exercises Stretching and breathing Focus and horse stanceIce bath! Warming up, tea Questions and closing the workshopFrequently asked questionsWhat are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?We're five minute walk from Booterstown Dart station. Lots of buses stop on the Rock Road nearby. It is a 20-minute cycle from the city centre to Booterstown. Grotto Avenue is just around the corner (if you're heading towards town) from the Punchbowl Pub.   What should I bring to the event?You'll need to bring a yoga / pilates mat. A towel, flip flops and swim wear for getting into the ice bath. Plus, a light blanket - sometimes people get cold during the breathing exercises. And please wear comfortable clothes as we will be moving and stretching.  Do I need to prepare for the workshop? When you sign up for the workshop, I will send you an information pack. It would be great if you could read through that before the workshop. In that will be a 20-day challenge. Don't worry: it will take less than a minute per day to complete! Also, health declaration and informed consent forms for you to fill-out.How do I practise the method safely?The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practised in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practise the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practised responsibly, there is a risk of hypothermia.Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you're epileptic. People with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting the Wim Hof Method. \n",
