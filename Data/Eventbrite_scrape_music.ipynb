      "Rokui (akt. Tadas Gryn) puikiai sekasi. Jis idealiai tvarkosi su visomis finansinėmis užduotimis, kurias jam paveda investuotojų fondas „3D Klubas”: jaunų bei ambicingų verslininkų – Daliaus, Dainiaus ir Dominyko susivienijimas. Rokas – Dominyko draugas nuo vaikystės – tapo Klubo suklestėjimo priežastimi. Ne veltui dėl savo „uoslės” pinigams jis gavo Kauko pravardę. Žiūrovas susipažįsta su Kauku, kuomet šis jau yra kone savo pasiekimų zenite. Po paskutiniosios užduoties jis taps pilnateisiu „3D Klubo” nariu. Rokas išvyksta į Klaipėdą, kurioje ir turi sutvarkyti pastarąjį reikalą.\n",
      "Labiausiai šio momento laukia Roko žmona Irma. Pagaliau jos vyras pradės gyventi ramesnį gyvenimą ir daugiau laiko skirti šeimai. Rokas ir Irma iš pažiūros ideali pora. O neįgaliojo sūnaus auginimas, juos daro kone nenugalimus. Tačiau Rokas turi vieną problemą. Jis negali gyventi be kitų moterų. Antra vertus, jis turi ir tos bėdos sprendimą. Rokas niekada nesusitinka su ta pačia meiluže dar kartą ir visuomet sugrįžta pas žmoną ir sūnų. Todėl, įvykis, kai Rokas, išvykęs į Klaipėdą susižavi vietos gražuole Inga, neatrodo niekuo ypatingas. Tik štai netikėtai paaiškėja, kad šis susižavėjimas nevienadienis. Rokas įsimyli iki ausų. O meilė ir pinigai – tai jau sprogstamasis užtaisas, kuris iki pamatų sudrebins ramią ir snūduriuojančią Klaipėdą, o sprogimo banga sugriaus ne vieną likimą ir atims ne vieną gyvybę...\n",

Rokas – Dominyko draugas nuo vaikystės – tapo Klubo suklestėjimo priežastimi. Ne veltui dėl savo „uoslės” pinigams jis gavo Kauko pravardę. Žiūrovas susipažįsta su Kauku, kuomet šis jau yra kone savo pasiekimų zenite. Po paskutiniosios užduoties jis taps pilnateisiu „3D Klubo” nariu.

When she ends up in the hospital from an overdose, an inspector becomes set on discovering the demise of their affair.Starring Art Garfunkel, Theresa Russell, Harvey Kietel and Denholm ElliotRoeg's fifth feature film (following up Performance, Walkabout, Dont Look Now and The Man Who Fell to Earth) Bad Timing is a disturbing tale of sexual obsession so controversial that upon its release its own distributors Rank  called it \"a sick film made by sick people for sick people\".  After a brief release it was buried for twenty years but has since garnered critical acclaim and is one of the most innovative, strange and beautiful mergings of sound and image.  Nicolas Roeg was ahead of his time with his signature fragmented editing style termed Roegian. Love has never been more dangerous in this intense drama.Mark Cousins described it as \"a Douglas Sirk melodrama attacked by Edward Scissorhands\"Come along and decide for yourself.The screening will be followed by an informal discussion with director/producer Colin McKeown and film critic Peter Larkin \n",

Tadas Gryn) puikiai sekasi. Jis idealiai tvarkosi su visomis finansinėmis užduotimis, kurias jam paveda investuotojų fondas „3D Klubas”: jaunų bei ambicingų verslininkų – Daliaus, Dainiaus ir Dominyko susivienijimas. Rokas – Dominyko draugas nuo vaikystės – tapo Klubo suklestėjimo priežastimi. Ne veltui dėl savo „uoslės” pinigams jis gavo Kauko pravardę. Žiūrovas susipažįsta su Kauku, kuomet šis jau yra kone savo pasiekimų zenite. Po paskutiniosios užduoties jis taps pilnateisiu „3D Klubo” nariu. Rokas išvyksta į Klaipėdą, kurioje ir turi sutvarkyti pastarąjį reikalą.\\nLabiausiai šio momento laukia Roko žmona Irma. Pagaliau jos vyras pradės gyventi ramesnį gyvenimą ir daugiau laiko skirti šeimai. Rokas ir Irma iš pažiūros ideali pora. O neįgaliojo sūnaus auginimas, juos daro kone nenugalimus. Tačiau Rokas turi vieną problemą. Jis negali gyventi be kitų moterų. Antra vertus, jis turi ir tos bėdos sprendimą. Rokas niekada nesusitinka su ta pačia meiluže dar kartą ir visuomet sugrįžta pas žmoną ir sūnų. Todėl, įvykis, kai Rokas, išvykęs į Klaipėdą susižavi vietos gražuole Inga, neatrodo niekuo ypatingas. Tik štai netikėtai paaiškėja, kad šis susižavėjimas nevienadienis. Rokas įsimyli iki ausų. O meilė ir pinigai – tai jau sprogstamasis užtaisas, kuris iki pamatų sudrebins ramią ir snūduriuojančią Klaipėdą, o sprogimo banga sugriaus ne vieną likimą ir atims ne vieną gyvybę...\\nNenuspėjamas, intriguojantis, pavojingas ir romantiškas – visai kaip džiazas, toks antrasis „Pasmerktų” epopėjos filmas, kuriame, kaip ir pirmajame netrūks sąsajų su realaus gyvenimo istorijomis.\\n\\nFilmo režisierius Ramūnas Rudokas.

Rokas – Dominyko draugas nuo vaikystės – tapo Klubo suklestėjimo priežastimi. Ne veltui dėl savo „uoslės” pinigams jis gavo Kauko pravardę. Žiūrovas susipažįsta su Kauku, kuomet šis jau yra kone savo pasiekimų zenite. Po paskutiniosios užduoties jis taps pilnateisiu „3D Klubo” nariu.

Tik štai netikėtai paaiškėja, kad šis susižavėjimas nevienadienis. Rokas įsimyli iki ausų. O meilė ir pinigai – tai jau sprogstamasis užtaisas, kuris iki pamatų sudrebins ramią ir snūduriuojančią Klaipėdą, o sprogimo banga sugriaus ne vieną likimą ir atims ne vieną gyvybę...\\nNenuspėjamas, intriguojantis, pavojingas ir romantiškas – visai kaip džiazas, toks antrasis „Pasmerktų” epopėjos filmas, kuriame, kaip ir pirmajame netrūks sąsajų su realaus gyvenimo istorijomis.\\n\\nFilmo režisierius Ramūnas Rudokas.
