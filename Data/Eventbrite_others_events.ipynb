Instead of perceiving his addiction as a failure, he embraced a second chance at life and went to university to study the intricacies of human behaviour. Since then, he has become a keynote speaker, writer, PhD student, self-development coach, and lecturer in Trinity College and University College Dublin. With a relentless belief that we are what we think, his mission is to show people that change is possible, demonstrating actionable steps through a lived experience.  Based on his own experiences juggling a PhD, a speaking career, and his first book, Brian will discuss the tools and tactics he employs to perform at a high level without a care in the world. He will focus on three simple tools that will help people to build self-awareness, resilience, and clarity around their own busy lives. Having spent 15 years as a heroin addict, Brian will also share his own personal journey which led to the insights he now lives his life by. \n",

      "The National Observatory on Violence Against Women in partnership with the European Parliament are hosting a seminar to mark the 16 Day of Action to End Violence Against Women. Ireland, having signed the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (the Istanbul Convention) in 2015 which was subsequently ratified in 2019 it is now time for committed implementation.The Istanbul Convention is the first legally-binding instrument which creates a comprehensive legal framework and approach to combat violence against women and domestic violence and is focussed on preventing domestic violence from occuring, protecting person who have experienced violence, prosecuting persons accused of committing such acts, and ensuring integrated policies to address violence against women and domestic violence.  Previous 16 Days of Action Events have  addressed the issues and difficulties surrounding the prosecution of violence against women and domestic violence, and in 2018 the focus was on integrated policies and the GREVIO reporting structure. This year the 16 Days Event is highlighting the prevention and protection obligations under the Convention. Despite considerable legislative change in recent years there is still real urgency for effective and accountable implementation of the Convention and this year’s conference will examine: what has been done; what is being done; and, what needs to be done in this regard.  This will be examined through academic, state agencies, An Garda Siochana and civil society’s responses to preventing and protecting women from violence and domestic violence. We are delighted to announced that the confirmed speakers for this years event so far include:Drew Harris, Garda Commissioner; Nora Gibbons, Chair of the Independent Review into Familicide and Domestic Homicides; Prof. Shane Kilcommins, Head of School of Law University of Limerick;  Sarah Benson CEO Women’s Aid; Deaglan O’Briain, Dept.

      "TCD NeuroSoc is hosting Brian Pennie for this talk on 27th Nov at 6pm,  in LB11 (Lloyd Institute basement).Brian experienced his first day clean on the 8th of October 2013 after 15 years of chronic heroin addiction. Instead of perceiving his addiction as a failure, he embraced a second chance at life and went to university to study the intricacies of human behaviour. Since then, he has become a keynote speaker, writer, PhD student, self-development coach, and lecturer in Trinity College and University College Dublin. With a relentless belief that we are what we think, his mission is to show people that change is possible, demonstrating actionable steps through a lived experience.  Based on his own experiences juggling a PhD, a speaking career, and his first book, Brian will discuss the tools and tactics he employs to perform at a high level without a care in the world. He will focus on three simple tools that will help people to build self-awareness, resilience, and clarity around their own busy lives. Having spent 15 years as a heroin addict, Brian will also share his own personal journey which led to the insights he now lives his life by. \n",

      "The National Observatory on Violence Against Women in partnership with the European Parliament are hosting a seminar to mark the 16 Day of Action to End Violence Against Women. Ireland, having signed the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (the Istanbul Convention) in 2015 which was subsequently ratified in 2019 it is now time for committed implementation.The Istanbul Convention is the first legally-binding instrument which creates a comprehensive legal framework and approach to combat violence against women and domestic violence and is focussed on preventing domestic violence from occuring, protecting person who have experienced violence, prosecuting persons accused of committing such acts, and ensuring integrated policies to address violence against women and domestic violence.  Previous 16 Days of Action Events have  addressed the issues and difficulties surrounding the prosecution of violence against women and domestic violence, and in 2018 the focus was on integrated policies and the GREVIO reporting structure. This year the 16 Days Event is highlighting the prevention and protection obligations under the Convention. Despite considerable legislative change in recent years there is still real urgency for effective and accountable implementation of the Convention and this year’s conference will examine: what has been done; what is being done; and, what needs to be done in this regard.  This will be examined through academic, state agencies, An Garda Siochana and civil society’s responses to preventing and protecting women from violence and domestic violence. We are delighted to announced that the confirmed speakers for this years event so far include:Drew Harris, Garda Commissioner; Nora Gibbons, Chair of the Independent Review into Familicide and Domestic Homicides; Prof. Shane Kilcommins, Head of School of Law University of Limerick;  Sarah Benson CEO Women’s Aid; Deaglan O’Briain, Dept.

Instead of perceiving his addiction as a failure, he embraced a second chance at life and went to university to study the intricacies of human behaviour. Since then, he has become a keynote speaker, writer, PhD student, self-development coach, and lecturer in Trinity College and University College Dublin. With a relentless belief that we are what we think, his mission is to show people that change is possible, demonstrating actionable steps through a lived experience.  Based on his own experiences juggling a PhD, a speaking career, and his first book, Brian will discuss the tools and tactics he employs to perform at a high level without a care in the world. He will focus on three simple tools that will help people to build self-awareness, resilience, and clarity around their own busy lives. Having spent 15 years as a heroin addict, Brian will also share his own personal journey which led to the insights he now lives his life by.

Ireland, having signed the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (the Istanbul Convention) in 2015 which was subsequently ratified in 2019 it is now time for committed implementation.The Istanbul Convention is the first legally-binding instrument which creates a comprehensive legal framework and approach to combat violence against women and domestic violence and is focussed on preventing domestic violence from occuring, protecting person who have experienced violence, prosecuting persons accused of committing such acts, and ensuring integrated policies to address violence against women and domestic violence.  Previous 16 Days of Action Events have  addressed the issues and difficulties surrounding the prosecution of violence against women and domestic violence, and in 2018 the focus was on integrated policies and the GREVIO reporting structure. This year the 16 Days Event is highlighting the prevention and protection obligations under the Convention. Despite considerable legislative change in recent years there is still real urgency for effective and accountable implementation of the Convention and this year’s conference will examine: what has been done; what is being done; and, what needs to be done in this regard.  This will be examined through academic, state agencies, An Garda Siochana and civil society’s responses to preventing and protecting women from violence and domestic violence. We are delighted to announced that the confirmed speakers for this years event so far include:Drew Harris, Garda Commissioner; Nora Gibbons, Chair of the Independent Review into Familicide and Domestic Homicides; Prof. Shane Kilcommins, Head of School of Law University of Limerick;  Sarah Benson CEO Women’s Aid; Deaglan O’Briain, Dept.

Instead of perceiving his addiction as a failure, he embraced a second chance at life and went to university to study the intricacies of human behaviour. Since then, he has become a keynote speaker, writer, PhD student, self-development coach, and lecturer in Trinity College and University College Dublin. With a relentless belief that we are what we think, his mission is to show people that change is possible, demonstrating actionable steps through a lived experience.  Based on his own experiences juggling a PhD, a speaking career, and his first book, Brian will discuss the tools and tactics he employs to perform at a high level without a care in the world. He will focus on three simple tools that will help people to build self-awareness, resilience, and clarity around their own busy lives. Having spent 15 years as a heroin addict, Brian will also share his own personal journey which led to the insights he now lives his life by.

Then turn left for and about 1 km to the Ski Club entrance on the right.\"}, {'title': 'UCD College of Arts and Humanities Annual Lecture with Sarah Moss at MoLI', 'url': 'https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/ucd-college-of-arts-and-humanities-annual-lecture-with-sarah-moss-at-moli-tickets-82186145975?aff=ebdssbdestsearch', 'price': 'Free', 'image': 'https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F81293463%2F373905167175%2F1%2Foriginal.20191115-162416?w=512&auto=compress&rect=0%2C31%2C1024%2C512&s=3add6f5b4116fa2dae81db72e72019ce', 'date': '28 November 2019', 'location': 'Museum of Literature Ireland  ( MoLI)  • Dublin', 'category': 'OTHERS', 'description': 'We are delighted to welcome award-winning novelist and literary scholar Professor Sarah Moss to deliver the 2019 UCD Arts and Humanities Annual Lecture at Museum of Literature Ireland (MoLI), titled: \"Feet in Ancient Time: Reflecting on Literary Inheritance in the Age of Brexit\" In her lecture,  Sarah will explore the personal, creative and national challenges around the idea of literary and poetic inheritance.

Ireland, having signed the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (the Istanbul Convention) in 2015 which was subsequently ratified in 2019 it is now time for committed implementation.The Istanbul Convention is the first legally-binding instrument which creates a comprehensive legal framework and approach to combat violence against women and domestic violence and is focussed on preventing domestic violence from occuring, protecting person who have experienced violence, prosecuting persons accused of committing such acts, and ensuring integrated policies to address violence against women and domestic violence.  Previous 16 Days of Action Events have  addressed the issues and difficulties surrounding the prosecution of violence against women and domestic violence, and in 2018 the focus was on integrated policies and the GREVIO reporting structure. This year the 16 Days Event is highlighting the prevention and protection obligations under the Convention. Despite considerable legislative change in recent years there is still real urgency for effective and accountable implementation of the Convention and this year’s conference will examine: what has been done; what is being done; and, what needs to be done in this regard.  This will be examined through academic, state agencies, An Garda Siochana and civil society’s responses to preventing and protecting women from violence and domestic violence. We are delighted to announced that the confirmed speakers for this years event so far include:Drew Harris, Garda Commissioner; Nora Gibbons, Chair of the Independent Review into Familicide and Domestic Homicides; Prof. Shane Kilcommins, Head of School of Law University of Limerick;  Sarah Benson CEO Women’s Aid; Deaglan O’Briain, Dept. Justice and Equality; Tessa Collins, Pavee Point; Frances Fitzgerald MEP will open the event   Please advise Susan McCormack by email at susanmcc@nwci.ie , if you have any special requirements (for example ISL interpretation or accessibility needs) by the 29th November.
