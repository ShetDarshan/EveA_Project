What most people don't know was that the album's triumph came after a decade of hard work. The quartet met while attending the University of South Carolina in Columbia in the late 1980's. New freshman Mark Bryan heard Darius Rucker singing in the showers of the dorm they shared and was impressed by his vocal ability. Bryan and Rucker began playing cover tunes as The Wolf Brothers and eventually hooked up with Dean Felber, a former high school bandmate of Bryan's, and Brantley Smith as Hootie & The Blowfish. (The unlikely moniker was borrowed from the nicknames of two college friends.) When Smith's true passion called him home to Greenville, SC in 1989, Bryan reached out to classmate Jim (Soni) Sonefeld to join the band and the immediate chemistry was undeniable!\\nBy the time they graduated, endless gigs at frat parties and local bars had built a major local buzz. “We'd started adding original material to our repertoire,” Bryan recalled. “Our songs went over well, so we decided to see if we could make a career out of it.

The vast majority of current Church members (around 84% worldwide and considerably higher in Ireland) were baptised as babies. For the Catholic majority in Ireland this has resulted in the imposition of onerous obligations on children long before they are equipped to evaluate them or agree to them. However, a more fundamental issue still lies unresolved and that is always allowing the right of parents to present their child for Baptism and raise the child in their faith, whether the child can, in international human rights law, be held to denominational membership and obligations entered when he or she was non sui compos.\\nThis has special significance for Ireland given the dominant position of the Catholic Church particularly in education and healthcare in Ireland but the general issues addressed have transferable implications for other denominations and faith systems.

In the past twenty-five years, that city has been overlaid by another, a global city, connected outwards as a global hub in a connected world. This lecture will explore some of the ways in which these two Dublins have been imagined by the city's novelists, from contemporary works by writers such as Sally Rooney, Benjamin Black, Paul Murray and Anne Enright, but also looking back to Joyce and his contemporaries.
