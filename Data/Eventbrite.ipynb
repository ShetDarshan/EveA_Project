Guy Flouch of the Irish-based EUNiCAS application support service, comments that:\\n\\u201cDutch Research Universities and Universities of Applied Sciences have a very high global reputation. Despite that, they are not particularly interested in your Leaving Cert points [or your grades, for postgraduate progrmmes] for entry, since they embrace the notion of you having a\\u00a0\\\"right to an education\\\".\\u00a0Tuition Fees which, at EUR2083 (2019), are already very low, can be recouped by way of a low-interest loan from the Dutch government. Add to that, the attractiveness of graduates from these institutions, to employers, in an increasingly globalised employment market, it is definitely worth thinking about\\u201d\\nSpeaking at the event, in addition to representatives of the universities, and their students, will also be the Dutch Embassy and mulinational employers.Subject areas offered by these institutions,\\u00a0at both undergraduate and postgraduate level,\\u00a0include\\u00a0International Law, Psychology, Physiotherapy, Business, Game Design, Medicine, Public Health, Pharmacy, Biomedicine, International Relations/European Studies, Languages, Natural Sciences, Computer Science, Engineering, Hotel Management, Music, Fine Art and many more.\\nThe following institutions are already confirmed as partcipating, and more will join in coming weeks:\\nAvans University of Applied SciencesFontys University of Applied Sciences\\u00a0Hanze University of Applied Sciences GroningenIn Holland University of Applied SciencesRadboud UniversityTilburg UniversityUniversity of GroningenUniversity of MaastrichtUniversity of TwenteWindesheim University of Applied Sciences\\nSchedule:19.00 - 20.00Presentations on studying in the Netherlands, including Q&A with Irish students currently studying in the Netherlands\\u00a020.00 - 21.30\\u00a0Exhibition of participating universities, giving you an opportunity to discuss with them, informally, their programmes and admissions procedures.\"\n",

      "With over 1000 Irish students now registered on degree programmes, taught through English, in Dutch universities, the universities themselves are starting to notice. \n",
      "On foot of a recent series successful OMG events, accross the country, organised by EUNiCAS, Dutch universities are visiting Dublin, to speak to prospective Irish students and their families. Importantly, Irish students, currently studying in the Netherlands, will be available for a chat on the night.So why the Netherlands? Guy Flouch of the Irish-based EUNiCAS application support service, comments that:\n",
      "“Dutch Research Universities and Universities of Applied Sciences have a very high global reputation. Despite that, they are not particularly interested in your Leaving Cert points [or your grades, for postgraduate progrmmes] for entry, since they embrace the notion of you having a \"right to an education\". Tuition Fees which, at EUR2083 (2019), are already very low, can be recouped by way of a low-interest loan from the Dutch government. Add to that, the attractiveness of graduates from these institutions, to employers, in an increasingly globalised employment market, it is definitely worth thinking about”\n",
      "Speaking at the event, in addition to representatives of the universities, and their students, will also be the Dutch Embassy and mulinational employers.Subject areas offered by these institutions, at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, include International Law, Psychology, Physiotherapy, Business, Game Design, Medicine, Public Health, Pharmacy, Biomedicine, International Relations/European Studies, Languages, Natural Sciences, Computer Science, Engineering, Hotel Management, Music, Fine Art and many more.\n",

      " \n",
      "Since Brigid Laffan began work at the European University Institute (EUI) in 2013, she has lived in the hills outside Florence near the village of Fiesole. Nearby is a small village called Santa Brigida. The village is a reminder of deep historic links between Ireland and the continent, as it is named after Ireland’s female patron saint, St. Brigid. In the 9th century, Donatus, an Irish man, was Bishop of Fiesole and he wrote ‘The Life of St. Brigid’, which developed into a cult of St. Brigid in this region. When Ireland joined the EU in January 1973, it represented a commitment by Ireland to share sovereignty with its partners in Europe but also to renew the ties that bound it to the continent, to return to Europe.\n",
      "Professor Brigid Laffan is the Director of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies and the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. To hear her crucial and insightful observations, join her this afternoon for an exploration and discussion of Ireland’s future engagement with the EU in the context of Brexit and the fundamental challenges of global and European politics.\n",

      "Stories for Our Times? Retelling the Norse Myths\n",
      "The Norse Myths, published by Quercus in 2018, is the latest in a long line of retellings of the myths and legends of medieval Scandinavia; tales that, as the publisher’s blurb points out, ‘have captured the imagination of storytellers and artists for centuries’. Reworking the Norse myths for a commercial press offered an opportunity to reflect on both the longstanding creative appeal of the myths and also the extraordinary resurgence of interest in recent years: what exactly is it about the Vikings and the stories of the Norse gods that makes them such a source of fascination for a twenty-first-century audience? This talk will draw out some of the points of connection, and fracture, that a popular retelling rests upon, and suggest some of the ways that a reworking of traditional material can be used to speak to contemporary concerns whilst also seeking to remain faithful to the medieval sources and to the contradictions and plurality of the myths that have come down to us. \n",

He publishes on Old English and medieval Icelandic textual and literary culture, and has recently led two IRC-funded projects in Cork on the translation of medieval poetry, and on the popular perception of the Vikings (the World-Tree Project). A new collection on Reimagining the Vikings is in press with Medieval Institute Publications, and his Norse Myths, an illustrated retelling of stories about the Norse gods, was published by Quercus last December.\n",

The book will be launched by Harry Clifton, and the evening is kindly co-hosted by Hodges Figgis bookshop in Dublin. Refreshments will be provided, and copies of the book will be available to purchase. Please let us know you can make it by reserving a free Eventbrite ticket and visiting the Facebook event.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is time? Our understanding of it changes, between when the angels rejoiced at the incarnation to when Einstein and then Feynman reconceived it. In the strange, unregulated and disorienting world of the web we experience it in new ways, its predictabilities wrested from us. In Mary O’Malley’s Demeter and Persephone sequence, time is experienced through generations, but the new gods play differently and spin the clock hands in their own mischievous ways. New generations find the time-patterns and expectations of their predecessors arcane and incomprehensible, and vice versa. Through mythology and ecology, this book sets out to restore connections. The book opens with oranges orbiting a Winter kitchen. Time in its dozen guises moves through the poems, as does fate. \n",
      "Mary O’Malley was born in Connemara in Ireland, and educated at University College Galway. She lived in Lisbon for eight years and taught at the Universidade Nova there. She served on the council of Poetry Ireland and was on the Committee of the Cuirt International Poetry Festival for eight years. She was the author of its educational programme. She taught on the MA programmes for Writing and Education in the Arts at NUIGalway for ten years, held the Chair of Irish Studies at Villanova University in 2013, and has held Residencies in Paris, Tarragona, New York, NUI Galway, as well as in Derry, Belfast. She is active in environmental education, specifically marine. She is a member of Aosdana and has won a number of awards for her poetry, including the 2016 Arts Council University of Limerick Writer's Fellowship. She writes and broadcasts for RTE Radio regularly. Mary O’Malley was appointed 2019 Writer Fellow at Trinity College Dublin.\n",
